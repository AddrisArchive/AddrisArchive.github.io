Hi, I’m London, but I go by Addri online.

Addri’s Archive is a personal literary space where I collect
reflections, essays, and poetry written over time.

My prose explores quiet observations and day-to-day thoughts,
while my poetry carries a more somber, rhythmic tone.

This archive exists as both a record and a process —
a place for writing to live as it grows.
